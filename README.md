## Approach Used  🧹

### 1. Data Wrangling  
- Checked for duplicates and removed them  
- Standardized data formats  
- Identified and handled null or missing values using appropriate techniques  
- Removed irrelevant columns and rows for a cleaner dataset

> *Note: Some fields in the table contain null values. These were addressed as part of the data cleaning process.*

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Used SQL queries to explore key questions  
- Applied aggregate and window functions to discover patterns and trends over time

## ⚙️ How to Use
- Load `layoffs.csv` into MySQL Workbench
- Run `layoffs_cleaning.sql` **first** to clean and prepare the data  
- Then run `layoffs_analysis.sql` to explore and analyze the cleaned data
